# FlashTime
FlashTime is an interactive flashcard making website create for HackEd 2019 in ICS4U. FlashTime is overall an effective study tool, as it creates an environment where students can access and create their flashcards quickly and in a user-friendly way, giving it advantage above overly-complex competitors like Quizlet.

## Using FlashTime
The live FlashTime can be accessed [here](https://ayjackson-ics4u.github.io/SAA-HackEd/src/index.html) on our GitHub Pages site. 

## HackEd
HackEd is a hackathon put on by Mr. Osudar's ICS4U class to promote a real-word coding experience. The goal is to create a functional educational app within two weeks that solves a problem faced by students. The final product at the end of the two weeks should be a hosted app and a GitHub repo that effectively documents the app-creation process.
